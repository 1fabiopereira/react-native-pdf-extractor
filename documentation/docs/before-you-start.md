# Before you start

React Native Pdf Extractor is a module, dependent on and intended to be used alongside [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), so some experience with it and knowledge of core concepts is required. If you feel the need, you can start with their [getting started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) tutorial, and then come back here when you're ready.

Currently, this module is only compatible for Android devices, we assume that you have all Android environment right configured, in case you don't have, we suggest that you make it first and then come back here to continue.

If you see something wrong with this module, feel free to report a issue on [github](https://github.com/1fabiopereira/react-native-pdf-extractor), pull requests are encouraged. You can know more about it on [Contributing](https://1fabiopereira.github.io/react-native-pdf-extractor/docs/contributing) session.
