# Playground

You can see an implementation example in `sample/` directory.

To get started with the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
yarn
```

Go to `sample/` directory and then:

To start the packager:

```
 yarn start --reset-cache
```

To run the example app on Android:

```
yarn run android
```

> If all goes well you will see something like:

<img src="../../img/sample.png" width="320px" alt="Image of sample" />
